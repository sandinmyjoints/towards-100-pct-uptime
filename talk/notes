# Real world example


- Bursts of errors in application log
- What is happening?


### What happens when
### a client makes a request
### and the underlying tcp connection
### is closed without a response?

Note:
- If errors aren't handled correctly, user agents may resend bad requests
and cause even more trouble.


The client will open a new connection and retry.

This is in the HTTP spec.


### Question 2
## What do the Node docs say to do on an uncaught exception?


Kill the process.


So what happens when I POST a charge to /api/billing and something goes
wrong and the server throws?


If no other workers, maybe nothing happens -- maybe error while waiting for
a new worker to come up.


If using cluster, then
- another POST! maybe repeating a charge, if that part went through? who knows!

TODO: demo this


No response is a big problem for clients, and for us
- seems to hang, and some clients will resend the request multiple times,
possibly triggering some error on more workers if you are using workers.



If I had known the 4 keys to uptime

nginx: `proxy_next_upstream`
http://wiki.nginx.org/HttpProxyModule#proxy_next_upstream
- if *any* data has been sent, you're stuck to the upstream
- if the request caused this error that crashed the upstream, then this will
crash your next upstream, too
